This program is a full android application that allows the user to set a desired time to set off a timer. The user inputs hours, 
mins and seconds and then presses the start button. After pressing the start button the text in the orange circle starts a countdown timer
and the timer is decremented one second at a time. When the time runs out an annoying alarm is set off which can be turned off by pressing 
the stop button. At anytime during the count down the user may push the pause button to pause the time currently on the counter. The time 
may continue when the user presses the start or pause button. At anytime if a user presses the stop button the timer display will be stopped
and cleared to "00:00:00". Also, if the user presses clear the time will be cleared and all entry fields will be cleared.
